# Responsive-Page

It is a simple exercise which allowed me to apply some basic responsive concepts and first mobile pattern in a simple web page. You are free to download the project if you want to practice or improve some of the concepts of a simple web page. This page uses the three main technologies: `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`.

## Structure
This project is composed of a main file, with three folders: The first and second one are the CSS folder and JS folder, respectively, and the last one contains all the images used in the page.
